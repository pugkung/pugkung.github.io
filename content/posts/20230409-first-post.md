This is the first blog post for my personal site. I will keep up to explore new things and share my knowledge over this blog from time to time.

I used to write a few entries on [Medium](https://medium.com/@pugkung), but I found that it lacks flexibilty to post things like code snippets (without drawing diagram or writing code elsewhere). After exploring some static-site generators that support blogging and Markdown, I think this might be more suitable for simplicity and support what I might be writting.

For example, writing things in markdown format could support writing simple stuff such as tables and code snippet easily

```
| Syntax       | Medium | Markdown |
| ------------ | - | - |
| Reachability | ✓ | ❌ |
| Page Customization | ❌ | ✓ |
| URL	       | ✓ | ✓ |
| Image	       | ✓ | ✓ |
| Table        | ❌ | ✓ |
| Code Snippet | ❌ | ✓ |
```

The above code would be automatically translate into the table below.

| Syntax       | Medium | Markdown |
| ------------ | - | - |
| Reachability | ✓ | ❌ |
| Page Customization | ❌ | ✓ |
| URL	       | ✓ | ✓ |
| Image	       | ✓ | ✓ |
| Table        | ❌ | ✓ |
| Code Snippet | ❌ | ✓ |

Surplus, I think it would be helpful to use markdown language as it could be apply to write documentation on  repositories (eg. readme file)
